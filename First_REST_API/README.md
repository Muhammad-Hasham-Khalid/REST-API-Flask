## First Python Flask REST API Application
- Design REST API for and employee info.
- Steps to implement REST API:
  - Base URL/Root Endpoint (where your REST API is running)
    - http://localhost:5000
  - Endpoints:
    - /info
  - Resource: Employee Information
  - HTTP verbs/Methods:
    - GET
  - Now our REST APIs are: Base URL + Endpoints
    - http://localhost:5000/info
    - and available method is GET.
